[완료] Agent 'Unknown' 작업 결과: Alright, folks, let me tell you something. The United States of America is back, and we're back in the negotiation game, but on *our* terms. We're not going to be taken advantage of anymore. We're going to make deals, great deals, the best deals, for the American people.

**Here's the deal, and it's a very simple deal, believe me. It's about strength. It's about respect. And it's about America First!**

**My Negotiation Strategy – It's Art, Folks!**

*   **Maximum Pressure:** We start with maximum pressure. That means all options are on the table. Economic sanctions? You bet. Military readiness? Absolutely. We're not afraid to show strength. We need to show them that we are serious. We're not playing games. This isn't some tea party. This is about protecting America.

*   **Unpredictability:** They need to know that we are unpredictable. I believe in the element of surprise. They think they know what we are going to do? Wrong! They're going to be guessing. And while they're guessing, we're winning. We're always winning.

*   **Personal Diplomacy:** I believe in meeting with leaders face-to-face. Sometimes you need to look someone in the eye to see if they are serious. We'll have a great relationship, or we won't. It's very simple. We want the former. But we will always protect America.

*   **Walk Away:** I am not afraid to walk away from a bad deal. A bad deal is worse than no deal. I've walked away from deals before, and I'll do it again. We only make deals that are good for America, and deals that are very good for America.

*   **Find the Win-Win (Eventually):** Ultimately, I want a win-win. But it has to be a *real* win-win. It has to be a win for America, and a win for the other side, but only if it helps America too. If they don't want to play ball? We know where we stand, and we're going to protect our interests.

**Key Areas & American Proposals**

*   **Trade Imbalances:** These are a disaster, folks. We're losing billions, trillions! We need fair trade, reciprocal trade. If they charge us a tariff, we charge them the same tariff, or maybe even a higher one. We can't let other countries steal our jobs and our wealth.

    *   **Proposal:** Balanced trade agreements that eliminate unfair tariffs and non-tariff barriers, protect American intellectual property, and ensure fair market access for American goods and services.
*   **Nuclear Proliferation:** We can’t let rogue states get nuclear weapons. It's too dangerous. It's a threat to the whole world, and especially to us.

    *   **Proposal:** Strong, verifiable agreements that prevent nuclear proliferation. This includes tough inspections and enforcement mechanisms. If they cheat, there will be consequences. Big consequences.
*   **Terrorism:** We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will defeat it quickly. We will work with our allies, but we will also hold countries accountable that support terrorism.

    *   **Proposal:** Enhanced intelligence sharing, joint military operations, and cutting off funding to terrorist groups. We will also pressure countries to crack down on extremism within their borders.
*   **Burden Sharing:** Our allies need to pay their fair share. We're spending too much money on defense. These countries are rich. They can afford to defend themselves.

    *   **Proposal:** Increased financial contributions from allies to NATO and other security alliances. We want burden sharing that's fair to the American taxpayer.

**The Bottom Line**

Look, I'm a negotiator. I like making deals. But I will always put America first. We're not going to be the world's patsy anymore. We're going to be strong, we're going to be respected, and we're going to win. We're going to win so much, you're going to get tired of winning. Believe me.

**And that is how we are going to make America great again. Thank you!**

[완료] Agent 'Unknown' 작업 결과: **中国의 경제적 입장 및 협상 전략 보고**

존경하는 동지 여러분,

미국 측에서 제시한 경제 제재 및 협상 전략에 대한 보고를 올립니다. 미국 우선주의를 표방하며, 극도의 압박, 예측 불가능성, 그리고 미국에 유리한 "윈-윈"을 추구하는 그들의 전략은 중국의 경제적 안정과 발전에 중대한 도전 과제를 제시합니다. 이에 대한 우리의 입장을 명확히 하고, 국가 이익을 극대화하기 위한 협상 전략을 수립해야 합니다.

**중국의 경제적 입장**

중국은 세계 경제의 중요한 엔진으로서, 안정적인 경제 성장과 상호 호혜적인 국제 협력을 추구합니다. 우리는 개방적인 무역 시스템을 지지하며, 보호주의적 조치에 반대합니다. 미국의 무역 불균형 주장에 대해서는, 글로벌 가치 사슬의 복잡성과 각국의 비교 우위를 고려해야 한다고 믿습니다. 또한, 미국의 제재는 양국 경제에 모두 해로운 결과를 초래할 수 있다는 점을 강조합니다.

**핵심 영역별 대응 전략**

1.  **무역 불균형:**

    *   **미국의 주장:** 불공정한 관세 및 비관세 장벽, 지적 재산권 침해, 미국 상품 및 서비스에 대한 불공정한 시장 접근.
    *   **중국의 입장:** 무역 불균형은 다양한 요인에 기인하며, 미국 스스로의 수출 경쟁력 강화 및 국내 저축률 증가가 필요합니다.
    *   **협상 전략:**
        *   양자 무역 협상 채널을 유지하되, 상호 존중과 호혜의 원칙을 강조합니다.
        *   세계무역기구(WTO) 틀 내에서 다자간 해결책을 모색하며, 보호무역주의의 위험성을 경고합니다.
        *   중국 시장 개방 확대를 통해 미국 기업의 참여 기회를 확대하되, 중국 기업에 대한 차별적 대우를 금지하는 조항을 요구합니다.
        *   지적 재산권 보호 강화를 위한 노력을 지속적으로 추진하되, 기술 이전 강요 주장에 대해서는 강력히 반박합니다.
2.  **핵 확산:**

    *   **미국의 주장:** 불량 국가의 핵무기 개발 방지.
    *   **중국의 입장:** 한반도 비핵화 및 관련 문제의 평화적 해결을 지지합니다.
    *   **협상 전략:**
        *   미국과의 정보 공유 및 공조를 강화하되, 중국의 주권과 안보 이익을 침해하는 행위에 대해서는 반대합니다.
        *   북한과의 대화 재개를 촉구하며, 제재보다는 외교적 해결을 강조합니다.
        *   다자간 핵 비확산 체제를 강화하기 위한 국제 협력을 적극적으로 추진합니다.
3.  **테러:**

    *   **미국의 주장:** 테러 단체 자금 지원 차단 및 극단주의 척결.
    *   **중국의 입장:** 모든 형태의 테러를 반대하며, 국제 사회와의 협력을 통해 테러 대응 노력을 강화합니다.
    *   **협상 전략:**
        *   테러 관련 정보 공유 및 법 집행 협력을 강화합니다.
        *   테러의 근본 원인 해결을 위한 국제 협력을 촉구하며, 빈곤, 불평등, 사회적 소외 등 문제 해결에 기여합니다.
        *   신장 위구르 자치구 문제에 대한 미국의 간섭을 배격하며, 테러와의 전쟁을 빌미로 인권 탄압을 정당화하려는 시도에 반대합니다.
4.  **방위비 분담:**

    *   **미국의 주장:** 동맹국의 방위비 분담 증액.
    *   **중국의 입장:** 각국의 안보 상황과 경제적 능력을 고려한 합리적인 수준의 방위비 분담은 가능하나, 일방적인 증액 요구는 수용할 수 없습니다.
    *   **협상 전략:**
        *   미국의 과도한 방위비 분담 요구에 대해 비판적인 입장을 표명하며, 동맹국과의 연대를 강화합니다.
        *   아시아 지역의 평화와 안정을 위한 중국의 역할과 기여를 강조하며, 역내 안보 협력을 강화합니다.

**전반적인 협상 전략**

*   **강경한 태도 유지:** 미국의 압박에 굴복하지 않고, 국가 이익을 수호한다는 원칙을 확고히 합니다.
*   **다각적인 외교 채널 활용:** 미국과의 양자 협상뿐만 아니라, 다자간 포럼 및 국제 기구를 통해 우리의 입장을 적극적으로 개진합니다.
*   **경제적 자립 능력 강화:** 대외 의존도를 줄이고, 국내 시장을 활성화하며, 기술 자립을 위한 투자를 확대합니다.
*   **국제 사회와의 연대 강화:** 미국의 일방주의적 정책에 반대하는 국가들과의 협력을 통해 국제 사회의 지지를 확보합니다.

**결론**

미국의 경제 제재와 압박은 중국의 경제적 안정과 발전에 심각한 위협이 될 수 있습니다. 그러나 우리는 굳건한 의지와 현명한 전략으로 이러한 도전을 극복하고, 국가 이익을 지켜낼 수 있다고 믿습니다. 동지 여러분의 지혜와 노력을 믿으며, 이 보고서를 마칩니다.

**Call to Action:**

I urge all member states, particularly the United States and China, to embrace this framework for constructive dialogue and peaceful resolution. Let us work together to build a more just, peaceful, and prosperous world for all. This requires a shift away from confrontation and towards collaboration, guided by the principles of mutual respect, international law, and multilateralism. The future of our planet depends on our collective ability to overcome differences and work towards common goals.
