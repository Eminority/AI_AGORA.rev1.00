We drink an estimated 70 million cups of coffee in the UK every single day - but is this a good thing or bad thing for our health?﻿There’s a constant barrage of health reports that seem to contradict each other, and the reason is that it’s quite a complicated area, and one that researchers are still studying.

--- 청크 2 ---
Firstly, coffee contains a whole cocktail of chemicals. The most famous of these is caffeine.
Caffeine is produced as an insecticide by plants, and many species contain it – including Kola nuts (used to make Cola drinks), cocoa beans and tea leaves, as well as coffee beans. It is also now used in energy drinks and many painkillers, as caffeine appears to enhance the action of painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. It also has a number of other effects on our bodies:

--- 청크 3 ---
A chemical called adenosine normally builds up in our bodies as we are awake, and higher levels make us feel sleepy – it’s like our body’s natural egg-timer to tell us to start preparing to sleep. Caffeine, however, binds to the adenosine receptors in our brain and stops the sleepiness signal getting through, hence helping us stay awake.

--- 청크 4 ---
Caffeine also directly stimulates our nervous system, making us more alert and focussed (although too much can make you anxious and shaky), as well as increasing our levels of adrenaline – putting us into a ‘fight or flight’ state, which can cause an irregular heart beat and higher blood pressure. This over stimulation could be bad for those with high blood pressure already.

--- 청크 5 ---
However, coffee also contains a whole raft of other chemicals which can have very different effects. Many studies looking at the long-effects of caffeine are actually looking at the amount of coffee people drink and so some of the effects are most likely caused by other compounds in coffee rather than the caffeine.

--- 청크 6 ---
Coffee is very rich in a group of compounds called polyphenols, which are another form of defence that plants have against insects. They’re found in all sorts of fruit and vegetables and rich sources of them are often called ‘superfoods’ by the press. Regular coffee drinkers may be getting as much as 1g of these compounds a day simply from coffee – and that’s a lot!

--- 청크 7 ---
Polyphenols actually decrease blood pressure, reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke, and increase blood supply to the brain, possibly giving some protection against dementia.
So, how does the balance fall between the potentially negative effects of caffeine, and the potentially positive effects of the polyphenols?

--- 청크 8 ---
Well, to get the most polyphenols from your coffee, go for the lighter roasts (sometimes labelled grades 1-2), and to keep your caffeine levels safe, don’t drink more than a couple of cups of caffeinated coffee in an hour. Pregnant women, though, should keep to a maximum intake of 200mg – that’s 2 cups of filter coffee – a day.

            With millions sipping their morning coffee to start the day, recent research has generated new buzz about caffeine consumption.

--- 청크 2 ---
A large UK study from September found that moderate caffeine consumption from coffee or tea reduced the risk of developing multiple cardiometabolic diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Another study, published in January, concluded that drinking coffee in the morning was especially beneficial in reducing cardiovascular disease and premature death.

That’s nice to know, but what is the evidence for coffee’s health benefits? And what is the underlying physiological basis of these benefits? How much coffee is good for most people, according to these studies — and how much is too much? Should some people be especially careful about coffee consumption? And if you don’t like coffee, are there similar benefits from drinking tea or other beverages?

--- 청크 4 ---
To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    

CNN: What’s the evidence for coffee’s health benefits, and what is the underlying physiological basis of these benefits?

--- 청크 5 ---
Dr. Leana Wen: The evidence is quite strong. In addition to the recent studies, a plethora of research over decades has found that moderate consumption of coffee is associated with lowering the risk of developing multiple diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers and even dementia.

--- 청크 6 ---
Exactly why this is the case is not known, though there are several hypotheses. For instance, coffee contains chemicals that are thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, perhaps contributing to its effect on reducing cancer risk.

--- 청크 7 ---
Substances contained in coffee could help the body better use insulin and assist with blood sugar control. And some ingredients could help better process cholesterol, possibly contributing to protecting against negative outcomes. More research is needed to understand what components of coffee have beneficial health effects.

CNN: How much coffee is good for you?


Wen: Many of these studies found positive health effects at a moderate level of consumption, which is generally defined as between two and four cups of coffee per day.
    

            In the 2024 UK study, the risk of developing multiple new cardiometabolic diseases was reduced by over 48% for those who had three cups of coffee per day compared with those who didn’t drink or who drank less than one cup a day.

--- 청크 9 ---
According to a large 2022 study, the biggest decline in early mortality was seen for those who drank two to three cups of coffee a day. Interestingly, this study found that ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of early death the most (27%). Instant coffee had less of an effect (11%).

CNN: How much coffee is too much?


Wen: The concern with too much coffee is about consuming too much caffeine, which can cause heart palpitations, anxiety, restlessness and difficulty sleeping. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, 400 milligrams of caffeine per day is safe for most adults. That is approximately the amount in four 8-ounce cups of brewed coffee.

--- 청크 11 ---
Many people exceed this amount and experience no ill effects. But people who have sleep difficulties or other problems should be aware that these could be due to caffeine consumption.

CNN: What about caffeine from espresso, teas and sodas?

--- 청크 12 ---
Wen: One 1-ounce shot of espresso contains around 60 to 70 milligrams of caffeine. A cup of black tea typically has 40 to 50 milligrams of caffeine but can have as much as 90 milligrams. Green teas and white teas will have less caffeine. Sodas also vary in caffeine content, but typically a 12-ounce serving will have 3 milligrams to 70 milligrams of caffeine.

--- 청크 13 ---
Other drinks I want to be sure to flag are energy drinks. These drinks can contain large amounts of caffeine, often packing 200 or even 300 milligrams in one serving. People should be aware of the total amount of caffeine and other ingredients they are consuming through the day for all these different beverages. Sodas and energy drinks can contain a lot of added sugars, for instance, along with other chemicals that are not good for your health.

CNN: Should some people be especially careful about coffee consumption? 


Wen: Yes. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 12 do not consume caffeine. Children ages 12 to 18 should not exceed 100 milligrams of caffeine per day.

--- 청크 15 ---
Pregnant women should also be cautious about caffeine intake. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, less than 200 milligrams a day is not associated with miscarriage or preterm birth; it recommends limiting intake to under this amount during pregnancy. Small amounts of caffeine can pass from the breastfeeding mother to infant, but less than 300 milligrams a day should be safe for breastfeeding women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and

--- 청크 16 ---
to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

--- 청크 17 ---
Other people who should use caution include those with underlying heart conditions and those who use medications that could make someone more sensitive to the effects of caffeine, such as certain thyroid and antidepressant medications.
    

            In addition, people who have trouble sleeping should consider limiting their caffeine intake to the morning hours. Those who have questions about their specific medical circumstances should consult a health care provider.

CNN: What about those who don’t drink coffee? Can they get similar benefits from tea or other caffeinated beverages?


Wen: This is an interesting question. It’s not known at this time whether the health benefit from coffee is from the caffeine in the coffee, which could be replicated through non-coffee drinks, or whether they are intrinsic to what’s in the coffee itself.

There may be benefits to drinking tea, whether it contains a large amount of caffeine or not. Some studies have found that drinking tea is also associated with lower mortality and lower risk of some diseases. This benefit does not apply to other caffeine-containing drinks like energy drinks and sodas; whatever benefit the caffeine in these drinks could have would likely be negated by the negative health impacts of added sugars and other chemicals.

--- 청크 21 ---
In short, my takeaway from these studies about coffee isn’t that everyone needs to drink it. Adults who do probably have some health benefit if they drink it in moderation. Everyone needs to be aware of the total caffeine intake they have, and there are people — notably young children — who really should not be consuming caffeine.

CNN: Should some people be especially careful about coffee consumption? 


Wen: Yes. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 12 do not consume caffeine. Children ages 12 to 18 should not exceed 100 milligrams of caffeine per day.

--- 청크 36 ---
Pregnant women should also be cautious about caffeine intake. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, less than 200 milligrams a day is not associated with miscarriage or preterm birth; it recommends limiting intake to under this amount during pregnancy. Small amounts of caffeine can pass from the breastfeeding mother to infant, but less than 300 milligrams a day should be safe for breastfeeding women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and

--- 청크 37 ---
to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

--- 청크 38 ---
Other people who should use caution include those with underlying heart conditions and those who use medications that could make someone more sensitive to the effects of caffeine, such as certain thyroid and antidepressant medications.
    

            In addition, people who have trouble sleeping should consider limiting their caffeine intake to the morning hours. Those who have questions about their specific medical circumstances should consult a health care provider.

CNN: What about those who don’t drink coffee? Can they get similar benefits from tea or other caffeinated beverages?


Wen: This is an interesting question. It’s not known at this time whether the health benefit from coffee is from the caffeine in the coffee, which could be replicated through non-coffee drinks, or whether they are intrinsic to what’s in the coffee itself.

New research reveals how coffee and tea can affect risk of early death for adults with diabetes

There may be benefits to drinking tea, whether it contains a large amount of caffeine or not. Some studies have found that drinking tea is also associated with lower mortality and lower risk of some diseases. This benefit does not apply to other caffeine-containing drinks like energy drinks and sodas; whatever benefit the caffeine in these drinks could have would likely be negated by the negative health impacts of added sugars and other chemicals.

--- 청크 42 ---
In short, my takeaway from these studies about coffee isn’t that everyone needs to drink it. Adults who do probably have some health benefit if they drink it in moderation. Everyone needs to be aware of the total caffeine intake they have, and there are people — notably young children — who really should not be consuming caffeine.

A large UK study from September found that moderate caffeine consumption from coffee or tea reduced the risk of developing multiple cardiometabolic diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Another study, published in January, concluded that drinking coffee in the morning was especially beneficial in reducing cardiovascular disease and premature death.

That’s nice to know, but what is the evidence for coffee’s health benefits? And what is the underlying physiological basis of these benefits? How much coffee is good for most people, according to these studies — and how much is too much? Should some people be especially careful about coffee consumption? And if you don’t like coffee, are there similar benefits from drinking tea or other beverages?

--- 청크 46 ---
To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    

CNN: What’s the evidence for coffee’s health benefits, and what is the underlying physiological basis of these benefits?

--- 청크 47 ---
Dr. Leana Wen: The evidence is quite strong. In addition to the recent studies, a plethora of research over decades has found that moderate consumption of coffee is associated with lowering the risk of developing multiple diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers and even dementia.

--- 청크 48 ---
Exactly why this is the case is not known, though there are several hypotheses. For instance, coffee contains chemicals that are thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, perhaps contributing to its effect on reducing cancer risk.

--- 청크 49 ---
Substances contained in coffee could help the body better use insulin and assist with blood sugar control. And some ingredients could help better process cholesterol, possibly contributing to protecting against negative outcomes. More research is needed to understand what components of coffee have beneficial health effects.

CNN: How much coffee is good for you?


Wen: Many of these studies found positive health effects at a moderate level of consumption, which is generally defined as between two and four cups of coffee per day.
    

            In the 2024 UK study, the risk of developing multiple new cardiometabolic diseases was reduced by over 48% for those who had three cups of coffee per day compared with those who didn’t drink or who drank less than one cup a day.

--- 청크 51 ---
According to a large 2022 study, the biggest decline in early mortality was seen for those who drank two to three cups of coffee a day. Interestingly, this study found that ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of early death the most (27%). Instant coffee had less of an effect (11%).
    

CNN: How much coffee is too much?

--- 청크 52 ---
CNN: How much coffee is too much?


Wen: The concern with too much coffee is about consuming too much caffeine, which can cause heart palpitations, anxiety, restlessness and difficulty sleeping. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, 400 milligrams of caffeine per day is safe for most adults. That is approximately the amount in four 8-ounce cups of brewed coffee.

--- 청크 53 ---
Many people exceed this amount and experience no ill effects. But people who have sleep difficulties or other problems should be aware that these could be due to caffeine consumption.

CNN: What about caffeine from espresso, teas and sodas?

--- 청크 54 ---
Wen: One 1-ounce shot of espresso contains around 60 to 70 milligrams of caffeine. A cup of black tea typically has 40 to 50 milligrams of caffeine but can have as much as 90 milligrams. Green teas and white teas will have less caffeine. Sodas also vary in caffeine content, but typically a 12-ounce serving will have 3 milligrams to 70 milligrams of caffeine.

--- 청크 55 ---
Other drinks I want to be sure to flag are energy drinks. These drinks can contain large amounts of caffeine, often packing 200 or even 300 milligrams in one serving. People should be aware of the total amount of caffeine and other ingredients they are consuming through the day for all these different beverages. Sodas and energy drinks can contain a lot of added sugars, for instance, along with other chemicals that are not good for your health.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, less than 200 milligrams a day is not associated with miscarriage or preterm birth; it recommends limiting intake to under this amount during pregnancy. Small amounts of caffeine can pass from the breastfeeding mother to infant, but less than 300 milligrams a day should be safe for breastfeeding women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and

to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Other people who should use caution include those with underlying heart conditions and those who use medications that could make someone more sensitive to the effects of caffeine, such as certain thyroid and antidepressant medications.
    

            In addition, people who have trouble sleeping should consider limiting their caffeine intake to the morning hours. Those who have questions about their specific medical circumstances should consult a health care provider.

Wen: This is an interesting question. It’s not known at this time whether the health benefit from coffee is from the caffeine in the coffee, which could be replicated through non-coffee drinks, or whether they are intrinsic to what’s in the coffee itself.

There may be benefits to drinking tea, whether it contains a large amount of caffeine or not. Some studies have found that drinking tea is also associated with lower mortality and lower risk of some diseases. This benefit does not apply to other caffeine-containing drinks like energy drinks and sodas; whatever benefit the caffeine in these drinks could have would likely be negated by the negative health impacts of added sugars and other chemicals.

--- 청크 127 ---
In short, my takeaway from these studies about coffee isn’t that everyone needs to drink it. Adults who do probably have some health benefit if they drink it in moderation. Everyone needs to be aware of the total caffeine intake they have, and there are people — notably young children — who really should not be consuming caffeine.

(CNN) — With millions sipping their morning coffee to start the day, recent research has generated new buzz about caffeine consumption.

--- 청크 2 ---
A large UK study from September found that moderate caffeine consumption from coffee or tea reduced the risk of developing multiple cardiometabolic diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Another study, published in January, concluded that drinking coffee in the morning was especially beneficial in reducing cardiovascular disease and premature death.

--- 청크 3 ---
That’s nice to know, but what is the evidence for coffee’s health benefits? And what is the underlying physiological basis of these benefits? How much coffee is good for most people, according to these studies — and how much is too much? Should some people be especially careful about coffee consumption? And if you don’t like coffee, are there similar benefits from drinking tea or other beverages?

--- 청크 4 ---
To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.
CNN: What’s the evidence for coffee’s health benefits, and what is the underlying physiological basis of these benefits?

--- 청크 5 ---
Dr. Leana Wen: The evidence is quite strong. In addition to the recent studies, a plethora of research over decades has found that moderate consumption of coffee is associated with lowering the risk of developing multiple diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers and even dementia.

--- 청크 6 ---
Exactly why this is the case is not known, though there are several hypotheses. For instance, coffee contains chemicals that are thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, perhaps contributing to its effect on reducing cancer risk.

--- 청크 7 ---
Substances contained in coffee could help the body better use insulin and assist with blood sugar control. And some ingredients could help better process cholesterol, possibly contributing to protecting against negative outcomes. More research is needed to understand what components of coffee have beneficial health effects.
CNN: How much coffee is good for you?

--- 청크 8 ---
CNN: How much coffee is good for you?
Wen: Many of these studies found positive health effects at a moderate level of consumption, which is generally defined as between two and four cups of coffee per day.
In the 2024 UK study, the risk of developing multiple new cardiometabolic diseases was reduced by over 48% for those who had three cups of coffee per day compared with those who didn’t drink or who drank less than one cup a day.

--- 청크 9 ---
According to a large 2022 study, the biggest decline in early mortality was seen for those who drank two to three cups of coffee a day. Interestingly, this study found that ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of early death the most (27%). Instant coffee had less of an effect (11%).
CNN: How much coffee is too much?

--- 청크 10 ---
CNN: How much coffee is too much?
Wen: The concern with too much coffee is about consuming too much caffeine, which can cause heart palpitations, anxiety, restlessness and difficulty sleeping. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, 400 milligrams of caffeine per day is safe for most adults. That is approximately the amount in four 8-ounce cups of brewed coffee.

--- 청크 11 ---
Many people exceed this amount and experience no ill effects. But people who have sleep difficulties or other problems should be aware that these could be due to caffeine consumption.
CNN: What about caffeine from espresso, teas and sodas?

--- 청크 12 ---
Wen: One 1-ounce shot of espresso contains around 60 to 70 milligrams of caffeine. A cup of black tea typically has 40 to 50 milligrams of caffeine but can have as much as 90 milligrams. Green teas and white teas will have less caffeine. Sodas also vary in caffeine content, but typically a 12-ounce serving will have 3 milligrams to 70 milligrams of caffeine.

--- 청크 13 ---
Other drinks I want to be sure to flag are energy drinks. These drinks can contain large amounts of caffeine, often packing 200 or even 300 milligrams in one serving. People should be aware of the total amount of caffeine and other ingredients they are consuming through the day for all these different beverages. Sodas and energy drinks can contain a lot of added sugars, for instance, along with other chemicals that are not good for your health.

--- 청크 14 ---
CNN: Should some people be especially careful about coffee consumption?
Wen: Yes. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 12 do not consume caffeine. Children ages 12 to 18 should not exceed 100 milligrams of caffeine per day.

--- 청크 15 ---
Pregnant women should also be cautious about caffeine intake. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, less than 200 milligrams a day is not associated with miscarriage or preterm birth; it recommends limiting intake to under this amount during pregnancy. Small amounts of caffeine can pass from the breastfeeding mother to infant, but less than 300 milligrams a day should be safe for breastfeeding women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In the 2024 UK study, the risk of developing multiple new cardiometabolic diseases was reduced by over 48% for those who had three cups of coffee per day compared with those who didn’t drink or who drank less than one cup a day.

--- 청크 86 ---
According to a large 2022 study, the biggest decline in early mortality was seen for those who drank two to three cups of coffee a day. Interestingly, this study found that ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of early death the most (27%). Instant coffee had less of an effect (11%).

CNN: How much coffee is too much?
Wen: The concern with too much coffee is about consuming too much caffeine, which can cause heart palpitations, anxiety, restlessness and difficulty sleeping. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, 400 milligrams of caffeine per day is safe for most adults. That is approximately the amount in four 8-ounce cups of brewed coffee.

--- 청크 88 ---
Many people exceed this amount and experience no ill effects. But people who have sleep difficulties or other problems should be aware that these could be due to caffeine consumption.
CNN: What about caffeine from espresso, teas and sodas?

--- 청크 89 ---
Wen: One 1-ounce shot of espresso contains around 60 to 70 milligrams of caffeine. A cup of black tea typically has 40 to 50 milligrams of caffeine but can have as much as 90 milligrams. Green teas and white teas will have less caffeine. Sodas also vary in caffeine content, but typically a 12-ounce serving will have 3 milligrams to 70 milligrams of caffeine.

--- 청크 90 ---
Other drinks I want to be sure to flag are energy drinks. These drinks can contain large amounts of caffeine, often packing 200 or even 300 milligrams in one serving. People should be aware of the total amount of caffeine and other ingredients they are consuming through the day for all these different beverages. Sodas and energy drinks can contain a lot of added sugars, for instance, along with other chemicals that are not good for your health.

--- 청크 91 ---
CNN: Should some people be especially careful about coffee consumption?
Wen: Yes. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 12 do not consume caffeine. Children ages 12 to 18 should not exceed 100 milligrams of caffeine per day.

--- 청크 92 ---
Pregnant women should also be cautious about caffeine intake. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, less than 200 milligrams a day is not associated with miscarriage or preterm birth; it recommends limiting intake to under this amount during pregnancy. Small amounts of caffeine can pass from the breastfeeding mother to infant, but less than 300 milligrams a day should be safe for breastfeeding women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

--- 청크 93 ---
Other people who should use caution include those with underlying heart conditions and those who use medications that could make someone more sensitive to the effects of caffeine, such as certain thyroid and antidepressant medications.
In addition, people who have trouble sleeping should consider limiting their caffeine intake to the morning hours. Those who have questions about their specific medical circumstances should consult a health care provider.

--- 청크 94 ---
CNN: What about those who don’t drink coffee? Can they get similar benefits from tea or other caffeinated beverages?
Wen: This is an interesting question. It’s not known at this time whether the health benefit from coffee is from the caffeine in the coffee, which could be replicated through non-coffee drinks, or whether they are intrinsic to what’s in the coffee itself.

--- 청크 95 ---
There may be benefits to drinking tea, whether it contains a large amount of caffeine or not. Some studies have found that drinking tea is also associated with lower mortality and lower risk of some diseases. This benefit does not apply to other caffeine-containing drinks like energy drinks and sodas; whatever benefit the caffeine in these drinks could have would likely be negated by the negative health impacts of added sugars and other chemicals.

--- 청크 96 ---
In short, my takeaway from these studies about coffee isn’t that everyone needs to drink it. Adults who do probably have some health benefit if they drink it in moderation. Everyone needs to be aware of the total caffeine intake they have, and there are people — notably young children — who really should not be consuming caffeine.

(CNN) — With millions sipping their morning coffee to start the day, recent research has generated new buzz about caffeine consumption.

--- 청크 99 ---
A large UK study from September found that moderate caffeine consumption from coffee or tea reduced the risk of developing multiple cardiometabolic diseases such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Another study, published in January, concluded that drinking coffee in the morning was especially beneficial in reducing cardiovascular disease and premature death.

--- 청크 100 ---
That’s nice to know, but what is the evidence for coffee’s health benefits? And what is the underlying physiological basis of these benefits? How much coffee is good for most people, according to these studies — and how much is too much? Should some people be especially careful about coffee consumption? And if you don’t like coffee, are there similar benefits from drinking tea or other beverages?

--- 청크 101 ---
To help with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.
CNN: What’s the evidence for coffee’s health benefits, and what is the underlying physiological basis of these benefits?

--- 청크 102 ---
Dr. Leana Wen: The evidence is quite strong. In addition to the recent studies, a plethora of research over decades has found that moderate consumption of coffee is associated with lowering the risk of developing multiple diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers and even dementia.

--- 청크 103 ---
Exactly why this is the case is not known, though there are several hypotheses. For instance, coffee contains chemicals that are thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, perhaps contributing to its effect on reducing cancer risk.

--- 청크 104 ---
Substances contained in coffee could help the body better use insulin and assist with blood sugar control. And some ingredients could help better process cholesterol, possibly contributing to protecting against negative outcomes. More research is needed to understand what components of coffee have beneficial health effects.

There are a lot of ways to get your caffeine fix: espresso machine, pour-over, French press, moka pot. But my preferred method is a classic coffee maker — something that’s quick-brewing, simple to use, and produces multiple cups in one go.

--- 청크 3 ---
Before I set out to write this piece, I was under the impression that this was a novice choice, something that only people who cared more about convenience than the intricacies of their morning cup would keep on their counter. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. Sure, there are a lot of not-so-stellar machines out there (think: the random coffee maker at your Airbnb), but the market is also full of options that give your brew as much nuance and balance as any other method. I’ve tried

--- 청크 4 ---
and balance as any other method. I’ve tried quite a few over the years, from the $20 model I had in my first apartment (that one coffee pro swears is actually good) to the fancier model with more advanced mechanisms I use now.

--- 청크 5 ---
To help you find the maker best suited for your own routine, I describe those machines below, along with a myriad of others that the baristas, roasters, and coffee-shop owners I consulted with rely on for a solid, fuss-free cup (or two, or three). I also included a couple of dedicated cold-brew makers for the iced-coffee enthusiasts. And if you’re interested in all the other coffee gear I’ve written about, you can read my guides to the best coffee grinders, electric kettles, espresso machines,

This is a straightforward point, of course, but the capacity of a given coffee maker should be a factor in whether or not you choose it for your own setup. Most on this list brew up to eight or 10 cups, with two slightly bigger at 12 cups, and one smaller at four cups. Of course, you can also brew less. Then there are three machines that are able to brew a single cup at a time, helpful if the day-to-day coffee consumption in your household doesn’t require a giant pot. I detail those in the

require a giant pot. I detail those in the descriptions.

--- 청크 10 ---
While not quite as large as most espresso machines, coffee makers take up a considerable amount of counter space — certainly enough that it’s an important aspect to consider when buying one. I’ve noted the dimensions of each.

--- 청크 11 ---
Most coffee makers on this list brew into a stainless-steel thermal carafe, which keeps your coffee warm for a few hours without reheating it from below. This method is generally preferred by the pros since it doesn’t lead to burnt-tasting coffee. Three models we’ve noted, however, don’t do this, and two are for iced coffee.

The Bonavita Connoisseur has been my everyday coffee maker for a year now. I gave it the best in class badge because it satisfies the ideal coffee-maker trifecta: it’s simple to use, available at an approachable price point, and most crucially, makes delicious coffee. I simply measure grounds and pour water into their respective chambers the night before so in the morning, all I have to do is click the “on” button; even when making a full pot, it brews in just a few minutes. And when I go back

--- 청크 13 ---
brews in just a few minutes. And when I go back for my second (or third) cup, the insulated stainless-steel carafe has kept the coffee plenty warm without heating from below and making it taste burnt. The coffee this machine delivers is delicious. I’ve used everything from fancy small-batch beans sourced from a local coffee shop to Dunkin’ Donuts pre-ground and without fail, I find myself sipping on a smooth and balanced cup.

--- 청크 14 ---
To figure out why it works so well, I tapped a couple of professionals who also love the machine. One key reason is its ability to brew at the proper temperature. According to Ken Nye, owner of Ninth Street Espresso, few coffee makers “consistently bring water to that 198–202 degree range,” which he calls the “broadly agreed-upon standard.” As Nye explains, the Connoisseur also “maintains that temp throughout the brewing process.” The smoothness is thanks to its flat-bottomed basket that

--- 청크 15 ---
is thanks to its flat-bottomed basket that “spreads the grounds out evenly,” says George Howell, owner and founder of George Howell Coffee, as well as the shower-like spout that ensures consistent water distribution and extraction.

--- 청크 16 ---
One disclaimer: When the lid is secured on the pouring vessel, it doesn’t fit underneath the brewing basket on its platform. But this doesn’t bother me enough to give it a knock. I simply keep the finished coffee on the counter until it’s done and cleaned, and the lid sits nicely on the top of the machine itself when not in use.
Capcity: 8 cups | Size: 9” x 14.8” x 16.1” | Temperature hold: Thermal carafe

--- 청크 17 ---
I’ve been testing this OXO model for a couple of months now and like it just as much as the Bonavita. (I’ll continue to use it going forward, too, to make sure it holds up over time.) It’s just as simple to use: You turn it on, then select from two different settings (more on that in a moment). The machine automatically shuts off when finished (this takes a few minutes, but you can also turn it off manually if you prefer).

--- 청크 18 ---
One setting is for brewing five to eight cups of coffee into an insulated carafe, which is what I primarily use. The carafe has a tiny valve hole in the lid so that the coffee brews directly into the otherwise-covered vessel (as opposed to the Bonavita, which has a larger, fully open top that you cover after it’s done). “It traps heat and aromatics better,” says Noah McKeown, a general manager at Go Get Em Tiger in Los Angeles.

--- 청크 19 ---
But there’s also an insert filter that allows you to brew two to four cups of coffee instead of five to eight, which you can do directly into a mug for a single cup. The process is basically the same: You fill the chamber with the amount of water you want and add the corresponding amount of grounds. Then you just have to remember to slide the tab on the carafe over to the image of a mug and select the clearly marked button to start. In this case, the machine pulses out less water at a time and

--- 청크 20 ---
the machine pulses out less water at a time and there’s a bit more agitation when it hits the ground beans. Like the Bonavita, “it’s almost like making a pour-over but in your automatic coffee maker,” McKeown says. For recipe developer and cookbook author Samah Dada, having such a range is a huge plus. “In the morning I’ll brew a larger pot, but then in the afternoon when I need to chill a bit on caffeine and only want a cup, I’ll use that setting,” she says. The maker has a pedestal you can

she says. The maker has a pedestal you can flip up so your mug sits closer to where the coffee comes out to avoid splashing.

If you don’t want to spend the money on a more advanced machine, this Mr. Coffee machine will get the job done totally fine. I used it for a few years before switching to a stove-top percolator to save counter space (more on that below), and was never disappointed. It produced a smooth cup and was super simple to operate: I simply measured my ratio of ground beans to water and flipped the “on” switch.

--- 청크 23 ---
Jamie McCormick, co-owner of the East Village coffee shop Abraço, tells us he prefers to keep things as simple as possible when it comes to coffee machines. “People make a big to-do over a lot of nothing” when it comes to brewing equipment, he says. He thinks a plain old Mr. Coffee is a first-rate choice for any “amateur coffee roaster who wants to flatter their grounds.” But he also has an expert piece of advice: Since it doesn’t have a high-tech mechanism for distributing the water evenly

--- 청크 24 ---
mechanism for distributing the water evenly like some of the other models on this list, he says you can open the top flap while it’s brewing and “stir the grounds to make sure they all get hydrated.”

--- 청크 25 ---
Capacity: 3 cups | Size: 5.5” x 11.7” x 14.9”  | Temperature hold: Thermal carafe
Balmuda’s coffee maker brews up to three cups at a time, a smaller capacity than any other on this list (the OXO model below has specific settings for yielding a cup or two at a time, but does allow you to make up to eight). But for anyone who doesn’t need a giant pot, it brews a fantastically strong and nuanced cup.

--- 청크 26 ---
It works almost like an electric pour-over: You fill the back chamber with water, put your grounds into a cup at the top lined with a paper filter (just as you would for an actual pour-over), and the machine spurts out water in a sporadic and fountainlike way over the top, agitating the beans as it goes. The whole process takes only a few minutes. There’s a regular setting, a strong setting (though I didn’t notice much difference between these two), and an iced setting that dispels the water

--- 청크 27 ---
two), and an iced setting that dispels the water slower. The coffee doesn’t come out cool, but after I set it in the fridge for a couple of hours, it was clear the extraction process worked: It made my Dunkin’ pre-ground beans taste amazingly like fancy cold brew. Like Balmuda’s Instagram-famous steam toaster and electric kettle, it’s a sleekly designed product, too, with a matte black exterior, stainless-steel details, and a slim profile.

Capacity: 12 cups | Size: 8.86” x 7.28” x 10.83” | Temperature hold: Reheated from underneath via stovetop

--- 청크 29 ---
This is the coffee maker I used at home for several years before I moved on to the Bonavita — but I still love it (so much so that I’ve even kept it stored away for potential future use). It’s made entirely from stainless steel (save for a handle on one side and a little glass knob at the top), and using it is simple. You fill the main chamber with water (there are lines inside that tell you how many cups you’re adding), and then scoop your coffee grounds into a filter cup, no paper required.

--- 청크 30 ---
grounds into a filter cup, no paper required. The filter cup slides neatly on top of a thin pole inside the main chamber, followed by a perforated disk on top, and then you seal it shut with a tight-fitting lid. The brew time, first over medium-high heat, then over a slightly lower flame, is little more than ten minutes. Alison Carroll, founder of Wonder Valley, shares my enthusiasm for the percolator. For her, the analog process evokes a sense of nostalgia, and eliminates the need for

--- 청크 31 ---
a sense of nostalgia, and eliminates the need for electronics in the morning, which she appreciates. “It requires a bit of patience and attention to watch the color change through the sightglass, but it makes a damn fine cup of coffee,” she says.

--- 청크 32 ---
The vessel takes up no counter space, is exceedingly easy to clean (whether you’re handwashing or throwing the pieces in the dishwasher), and — though you have to keep your eye on it — is about as unfussy as it gets when it comes to actual coffee preparation (no standing there with a tea kettle pouring an even stream of water over grounds). Bonus: You can brew a big batch of tea in it, too.

The Technivorm Moccamaster was the second-most-recommended coffee maker by the experts I spoke with for this story. It’s pricey, but those who use it say it’s worth the premium if you want to invest in the best equipment out there. Like the Bonavita Connoisseur, the Moccamaster has stable temperature control and even brewing. Suyog Mody, founder of Driftaway Coffee, explains that while the “brewing mechanics” are similar to those used in less expensive drip coffee makers, the Moccamaster is

--- 청크 35 ---
expensive drip coffee makers, the Moccamaster is “made with better parts and solid construction. I’ve been using it daily for years with zero issues. It’s just no fuss. And honestly, it looks good on the kitchen counter.” (That’s one point on which John Gourley, the front man of Portugal. The Man, agrees: “Not only does it look amazing, but it’s just a drip-style coffee maker that’s probably the thing we use the most in our house.”)

--- 청크 36 ---
While the design is certainly appealing and the construction quality means it should last for a long time, the experts wouldn’t endorse this coffee maker if it didn’t also make a quality drink. “I taste coffee from all types of brewers, and this one gives a consistently better cup,” says Jim Munson, founder and president of Brooklyn Roasting Company. Ally Walsh, co-founder of Los Angeles’s Canyon Coffee, agrees, noting how smooth the brew comes out every time. There could be some science behind

--- 청크 37 ---
every time. There could be some science behind that. “It has nine holes or orifices instead of one, so the water spreads out over the whole area of a coffee filter. Plus the heater works very fast. You get coffee much faster,” says Bill Nye, the Science Guy, who makes his coffee in this machine. Another innovation he points out is the funnel shape of the lid, “which greatly reduces the evaporation rate while the thing’s sitting there on the burner. Why doesn’t every machine have this?”

--- 청크 38 ---
Jerad Morrison, co-founder and co-CEO of Sightglass in San Francisco, is also a fan of the Technivorm but prefers a slightly different model. His favorite has all the same attributes, but instead of dispensing your coffee into a glass carafe on top of a burner plate, it goes into a stainless-steel thermal one (just like the Connoisseur). “It keeps coffee plenty hot for several hours,” he says, “without changing the flavor or making it taste burnt.” This thermal-carafe model only comes in

burnt.” This thermal-carafe model only comes in neutral colors, but the glass has a bunch of shades to choose from.

The reason to invest in this machine is clear from the name: It comes with a built-in burr grinder. Yes, it’s on the spendier end, but grinders are quite pricey on their own — not to mention they take up additional space in your kitchen. Beyond the convenience, “the Capresso drip yields the cleanest-tasting cup,” says Kat Odell, author of Day Drinking. Finally, it boasts that thermal carafe that, as I’ve pointed out, many of the experts prefer over a hot plate.

If you want a single-unit coffee maker that can do it all, this Ninja fits the bill. It comes recommended by Strategist writer Arielle Avila who regularly uses the classic brew method (for a carafe of coffee), as well as the “specialty” setting that turns out a thick coffee concentrate, similar to espresso and used in the same manner for milk-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. The machine also has the capability of making iced coffee. Other bonuses include the attached milk frother and a

If you’re interested in a simple pod-based machine, this Nespresso also turns out single servings of espresso and coffee. Textile designer Caroline Hurley and clothing designer Alex Crane (both coffee fanatics) have used it every day for a few years and love it because “it’s just so easy,” Hurley says. You simply place a pod into the slot at the top and click a single button. The maker heats up and brews in seconds, then automatically deposits the used pod in a container in the back to empty

--- 청크 47 ---
the used pod in a container in the back to empty and recycle (with some specific guidelines).

--- 청크 48 ---
Crane says he appreciates that it only produces one cup at a time so he can watch his consumption. He also notes that it makes “a gentle sound, unlike some others that sound so loud and sinister.” Hurley, meanwhile, says it tastes just as fresh as when you grind your own beans and appreciates that the company offers a wide variety of flavors in a tester pack — “like jelly beans but for coffee” — so you can decide what you like best.

Cold brew makers are not exactly plug-in electric coffee makers, but they’re important nonetheless, especially for iced-coffee-year-round people. This one is a favorite of Dennis Ngo, chef and co-owner of Brooklyn restaurant Di an Di. “I got hooked on the smoothness and low acidity of cold-brewed coffee,” says Ngo. “It lets me tinker with different beans and concentrations. It also stacks for storage, which is an absolute requirement for my tiny New York apartment.”

Michael Philips, director of content and copy at Blue Bottle, recommends the Toddy Cold Brew System, a similarly priced model that he’s been using for nearly two decades in his own home. It’s a little over twice the size (67 ounces instead of 32), but that’s something he appreciates: He brews the concentrate once a week or so and is able to drink one to two cups a day from that amount before he has to start the process over. He’s also partial to the paper filters (the maker includes three to

--- 청크 52 ---
to the paper filters (the maker includes three to start that you can replenish). While they aren’t reusable like the stainless-steel, fine-mesh strainer that comes as part of the Oxo, he says that they “produce a much cleaner cup” with “absolutely no grit.”

This is a straightforward point, of course, but the capacity of a given coffee maker should be a factor in whether or not you choose it for your own setup. Most on this list brew up to eight or 10 cups, with two slightly bigger at 12 cups, and one smaller at four cups. Of course, you can also brew less.

There are a lot of ways to get your caffeine fix: espresso machine, pour-over, French press, moka pot. But my preferred method is a classic coffee maker — something that’s quick-brewing, simple to use, and produces multiple cups in one go.

--- 청크 62 ---
Before I set out to write this piece, I was under the impression that this was a novice choice, something that only people who cared more about convenience than the intricacies of their morning cup would keep on their counter. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. Sure, there are a lot of not-so-stellar machines out there (think: the random coffee maker at your Airbnb), but the market is also full of options that give your brew as much nuance and balance as any other method. I’ve tried

--- 청크 64 ---
To help you find the maker best suited for your own routine, I describe those machines below, along with a myriad of others that the baristas, roasters, and coffee-shop owners I consulted with rely on for a solid, fuss-free cup (or two, or three). I also included a couple of dedicated cold-brew makers for the iced-coffee enthusiasts. And if you’re interested in all the other coffee gear I’ve written about, you can read my guides to the best coffee grinders, electric kettles, espresso machines,

The Bonavita Connoisseur has been my everyday coffee maker for a year now. I gave it the best in class badge because it satisfies the ideal coffee-maker trifecta: it’s simple to use, available at an approachable price point, and most crucially, makes delicious coffee. I simply measure grounds and pour water into their respective chambers the night before so in the morning, all I have to do is click the “on” button; even when making a full pot, it brews in just a few minutes. And when I go back

--- 청크 72 ---
brews in just a few minutes. And when I go back for my second (or third) cup, the insulated stainless-steel carafe has kept the coffee plenty warm without heating from below and making it taste burnt. The coffee this machine delivers is delicious. I’ve used everything from fancy small-batch beans sourced from a local coffee shop to Dunkin’ Donuts pre-ground and without fail, I find myself sipping on a smooth and balanced cup.

--- 청크 73 ---
To figure out why it works so well, I tapped a couple of professionals who also love the machine. One key reason is its ability to brew at the proper temperature. According to Ken Nye, owner of Ninth Street Espresso, few coffee makers “consistently bring water to that 198–202 degree range,” which he calls the “broadly agreed-upon standard.” As Nye explains, the Connoisseur also “maintains that temp throughout the brewing process.” The smoothness is thanks to its flat-bottomed basket that

--- 청크 74 ---
is thanks to its flat-bottomed basket that “spreads the grounds out evenly,” says George Howell, owner and founder of George Howell Coffee, as well as the shower-like spout that ensures consistent water distribution and extraction.

--- 청크 75 ---
One disclaimer: When the lid is secured on the pouring vessel, it doesn’t fit underneath the brewing basket on its platform. But this doesn’t bother me enough to give it a knock. I simply keep the finished coffee on the counter until it’s done and cleaned, and the lid sits nicely on the top of the machine itself when not in use.
Capcity: 8 cups | Size: 9” x 14.8” x 16.1” | Temperature hold: Thermal carafe

--- 청크 76 ---
I’ve been testing this OXO model for a couple of months now and like it just as much as the Bonavita. (I’ll continue to use it going forward, too, to make sure it holds up over time.) It’s just as simple to use: You turn it on, then select from two different settings (more on that in a moment). The machine automatically shuts off when finished (this takes a few minutes, but you can also turn it off manually if you prefer).

--- 청크 77 ---
One setting is for brewing five to eight cups of coffee into an insulated carafe, which is what I primarily use. The carafe has a tiny valve hole in the lid so that the coffee brews directly into the otherwise-covered vessel (as opposed to the Bonavita, which has a larger, fully open top that you cover after it’s done). “It traps heat and aromatics better,” says Noah McKeown, a general manager at Go Get Em Tiger in Los Angeles.

--- 청크 78 ---
But there’s also an insert filter that allows you to brew two to four cups of coffee instead of five to eight, which you can do directly into a mug for a single cup. The process is basically the same: You fill the chamber with the amount of water you want and add the corresponding amount of grounds. Then you just have to remember to slide the tab on the carafe over to the image of a mug and select the clearly marked button to start. In this case, the machine pulses out less water at a time and

--- 청크 79 ---
the machine pulses out less water at a time and there’s a bit more agitation when it hits the ground beans. Like the Bonavita, “it’s almost like making a pour-over but in your automatic coffee maker,” McKeown says. For recipe developer and cookbook author Samah Dada, having such a range is a huge plus. “In the morning I’ll brew a larger pot, but then in the afternoon when I need to chill a bit on caffeine and only want a cup, I’ll use that setting,” she says. The maker has a pedestal you can

If you don’t want to spend the money on a more advanced machine, this Mr. Coffee machine will get the job done totally fine. I used it for a few years before switching to a stove-top percolator to save counter space (more on that below), and was never disappointed. It produced a smooth cup and was super simple to operate: I simply measured my ratio of ground beans to water and flipped the “on” switch.

Jamie McCormick, co-owner of the East Village coffee shop Abraço, tells us he prefers to keep things as simple as possible when it comes to coffee machines. “People make a big to-do over a lot of nothing” when it comes to brewing equipment, he says. He thinks a plain old Mr. Coffee is a first-rate choice for any “amateur coffee roaster who wants to flatter their grounds.” But he also has an expert piece of advice: Since it doesn’t have a high-tech mechanism for distributing the water evenly

--- 청크 83 ---
mechanism for distributing the water evenly like some of the other models on this list, he says you can open the top flap while it’s brewing and “stir the grounds to make sure they all get hydrated.”

--- 청크 84 ---
Capacity: 3 cups | Size: 5.5” x 11.7” x 14.9”  | Temperature hold: Thermal carafe
Balmuda’s coffee maker brews up to three cups at a time, a smaller capacity than any other on this list (the OXO model below has specific settings for yielding a cup or two at a time, but does allow you to make up to eight). But for anyone who doesn’t need a giant pot, it brews a fantastically strong and nuanced cup.

--- 청크 85 ---
It works almost like an electric pour-over: You fill the back chamber with water, put your grounds into a cup at the top lined with a paper filter (just as you would for an actual pour-over), and the machine spurts out water in a sporadic and fountainlike way over the top, agitating the beans as it goes. The whole process takes only a few minutes. There’s a regular setting, a strong setting (though I didn’t notice much difference between these two), and an iced setting that dispels the water

--- 청크 86 ---
two), and an iced setting that dispels the water slower. The coffee doesn’t come out cool, but after I set it in the fridge for a couple of hours, it was clear the extraction process worked: It made my Dunkin’ pre-ground beans taste amazingly like fancy cold brew. Like Balmuda’s Instagram-famous steam toaster and electric kettle, it’s a sleekly designed product, too, with a matte black exterior, stainless-steel details, and a slim profile.

This is the coffee maker I used at home for several years before I moved on to the Bonavita — but I still love it (so much so that I’ve even kept it stored away for potential future use). It’s made entirely from stainless steel (save for a handle on one side and a little glass knob at the top), and using it is simple. You fill the main chamber with water (there are lines inside that tell you how many cups you’re adding), and then scoop your coffee grounds into a filter cup, no paper required.

--- 청크 89 ---
grounds into a filter cup, no paper required. The filter cup slides neatly on top of a thin pole inside the main chamber, followed by a perforated disk on top, and then you seal it shut with a tight-fitting lid. The brew time, first over medium-high heat, then over a slightly lower flame, is little more than ten minutes. Alison Carroll, founder of Wonder Valley, shares my enthusiasm for the percolator. For her, the analog process evokes a sense of nostalgia, and eliminates the need for

--- 청크 90 ---
a sense of nostalgia, and eliminates the need for electronics in the morning, which she appreciates. “It requires a bit of patience and attention to watch the color change through the sightglass, but it makes a damn fine cup of coffee,” she says.

--- 청크 91 ---
The vessel takes up no counter space, is exceedingly easy to clean (whether you’re handwashing or throwing the pieces in the dishwasher), and — though you have to keep your eye on it — is about as unfussy as it gets when it comes to actual coffee preparation (no standing there with a tea kettle pouring an even stream of water over grounds). Bonus: You can brew a big batch of tea in it, too.

The Technivorm Moccamaster was the second-most-recommended coffee maker by the experts I spoke with for this story. It’s pricey, but those who use it say it’s worth the premium if you want to invest in the best equipment out there. Like the Bonavita Connoisseur, the Moccamaster has stable temperature control and even brewing. Suyog Mody, founder of Driftaway Coffee, explains that while the “brewing mechanics” are similar to those used in less expensive drip coffee makers, the Moccamaster is

--- 청크 94 ---
expensive drip coffee makers, the Moccamaster is “made with better parts and solid construction. I’ve been using it daily for years with zero issues. It’s just no fuss. And honestly, it looks good on the kitchen counter.” (That’s one point on which John Gourley, the front man of Portugal. The Man, agrees: “Not only does it look amazing, but it’s just a drip-style coffee maker that’s probably the thing we use the most in our house.”)

--- 청크 95 ---
While the design is certainly appealing and the construction quality means it should last for a long time, the experts wouldn’t endorse this coffee maker if it didn’t also make a quality drink. “I taste coffee from all types of brewers, and this one gives a consistently better cup,” says Jim Munson, founder and president of Brooklyn Roasting Company. Ally Walsh, co-founder of Los Angeles’s Canyon Coffee, agrees, noting how smooth the brew comes out every time. There could be some science behind

--- 청크 96 ---
every time. There could be some science behind that. “It has nine holes or orifices instead of one, so the water spreads out over the whole area of a coffee filter. Plus the heater works very fast. You get coffee much faster,” says Bill Nye, the Science Guy, who makes his coffee in this machine. Another innovation he points out is the funnel shape of the lid, “which greatly reduces the evaporation rate while the thing’s sitting there on the burner. Why doesn’t every machine have this?”

--- 청크 97 ---
Jerad Morrison, co-founder and co-CEO of Sightglass in San Francisco, is also a fan of the Technivorm but prefers a slightly different model. His favorite has all the same attributes, but instead of dispensing your coffee into a glass carafe on top of a burner plate, it goes into a stainless-steel thermal one (just like the Connoisseur). “It keeps coffee plenty hot for several hours,” he says, “without changing the flavor or making it taste burnt.” This thermal-carafe model only comes in

burnt.” This thermal-carafe model only comes in neutral colors, but the glass has a bunch of shades to choose from.

The reason to invest in this machine is clear from the name: It comes with a built-in burr grinder. Yes, it’s on the spendier end, but grinders are quite pricey on their own — not to mention they take up additional space in your kitchen. Beyond the convenience, “the Capresso drip yields the cleanest-tasting cup,” says Kat Odell, author of Day Drinking. Finally, it boasts that thermal carafe that, as I’ve pointed out, many of the experts prefer over a hot plate.

If you want a single-unit coffee maker that can do it all, this Ninja fits the bill. It comes recommended by Strategist writer Arielle Avila who regularly uses the classic brew method (for a carafe of coffee), as well as the “specialty” setting that turns out a thick coffee concentrate, similar to espresso and used in the same manner for milk-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. The machine also has the capability of making iced coffee. Other bonuses include the attached milk frother and a

If you’re interested in a simple pod-based machine, this Nespresso also turns out single servings of espresso and coffee. Textile designer Caroline Hurley and clothing designer Alex Crane (both coffee fanatics) have used it every day for a few years and love it because “it’s just so easy,” Hurley says. You simply place a pod into the slot at the top and click a single button. The maker heats up and brews in seconds, then automatically deposits the used pod in a container in the back to empty

--- 청크 106 ---
the used pod in a container in the back to empty and recycle (with some specific guidelines).

--- 청크 107 ---
Crane says he appreciates that it only produces one cup at a time so he can watch his consumption. He also notes that it makes “a gentle sound, unlike some others that sound so loud and sinister.” Hurley, meanwhile, says it tastes just as fresh as when you grind your own beans and appreciates that the company offers a wide variety of flavors in a tester pack — “like jelly beans but for coffee” — so you can decide what you like best.

Cold brew makers are not exactly plug-in electric coffee makers, but they’re important nonetheless, especially for iced-coffee-year-round people. This one is a favorite of Dennis Ngo, chef and co-owner of Brooklyn restaurant Di an Di. “I got hooked on the smoothness and low acidity of cold-brewed coffee,” says Ngo. “It lets me tinker with different beans and concentrations. It also stacks for storage, which is an absolute requirement for my tiny New York apartment.”

--- 청크 110 ---
Michael Philips, director of content and copy at Blue Bottle, recommends the Toddy Cold Brew System, a similarly priced model that he’s been using for nearly two decades in his own home. It’s a little over twice the size (67 ounces instead of 32), but that’s something he appreciates: He brews the concentrate once a week or so and is able to drink one to two cups a day from that amount before he has to start the process over. He’s also partial to the paper filters (the maker includes three to

--- 청크 111 ---
to the paper filters (the maker includes three to start that you can replenish). While they aren’t reusable like the stainless-steel, fine-mesh strainer that comes as part of the Oxo, he says that they “produce a much cleaner cup” with “absolutely no grit.”

Balmuda’s coffee maker brews up to three cups at a time, a smaller capacity than any other on this list (the OXO model below has specific settings for yielding a cup or two at a time, but does allow you to make up to eight). But for anyone who doesn’t need a giant pot, it brews a fantastically strong and nuanced cup.

It works almost like an electric pour-over: You fill the back chamber with water, put your grounds into a cup at the top lined with a paper filter (just as you would for an actual pour-over), and the machine spurts out water in a sporadic and fountainlike way over the top, agitating the beans as it goes. The whole process takes only a few minutes. There’s a regular setting, a strong setting (though I didn’t notice much difference between these two), and an iced setting that dispels the water

two), and an iced setting that dispels the water slower. The coffee doesn’t come out cool, but after I set it in the fridge for a couple of hours, it was clear the extraction process worked: It made my Dunkin’ pre-ground beans taste amazingly like fancy cold brew. Like Balmuda’s Instagram-famous steam toaster and electric kettle, it’s a sleekly designed product, too, with a matte black exterior, stainless-steel details, and a slim profile.

This is the coffee maker I used at home for several years before I moved on to the Bonavita — but I still love it (so much so that I’ve even kept it stored away for potential future use). It’s made entirely from stainless steel (save for a handle on one side and a little glass knob at the top), and using it is simple. You fill the main chamber with water (there are lines inside that tell you how many cups you’re adding), and then scoop your coffee grounds into a filter cup, no paper required.

--- 청크 144 ---
grounds into a filter cup, no paper required. The filter cup slides neatly on top of a thin pole inside the main chamber, followed by a perforated disk on top, and then you seal it shut with a tight-fitting lid. The brew time, first over medium-high heat, then over a slightly lower flame, is little more than ten minutes. Alison Carroll, founder of Wonder Valley, shares my enthusiasm for the percolator. For her, the analog process evokes a sense of nostalgia, and eliminates the need for

a sense of nostalgia, and eliminates the need for electronics in the morning, which she appreciates. “It requires a bit of patience and attention to watch the color change through the sightglass, but it makes a damn fine cup of coffee,” she says.

--- 청크 146 ---
The vessel takes up no counter space, is exceedingly easy to clean (whether you’re handwashing or throwing the pieces in the dishwasher), and — though you have to keep your eye on it — is about as unfussy as it gets when it comes to actual coffee preparation (no standing there with a tea kettle pouring an even stream of water over grounds). Bonus: You can brew a big batch of tea in it, too.

The Technivorm Moccamaster was the second-most-recommended coffee maker by the experts I spoke with for this story. It’s pricey, but those who use it say it’s worth the premium if you want to invest in the best equipment out there. Like the Bonavita Connoisseur, the Moccamaster has stable temperature control and even brewing. Suyog Mody, founder of Driftaway Coffee, explains that while the “brewing mechanics” are similar to those used in less expensive drip coffee makers, the Moccamaster is

--- 청크 149 ---
expensive drip coffee makers, the Moccamaster is “made with better parts and solid construction. I’ve been using it daily for years with zero issues. It’s just no fuss. And honestly, it looks good on the kitchen counter.” (That’s one point on which John Gourley, the front man of Portugal. The Man, agrees: “Not only does it look amazing, but it’s just a drip-style coffee maker that’s probably the thing we use the most in our house.”)

--- 청크 150 ---
While the design is certainly appealing and the construction quality means it should last for a long time, the experts wouldn’t endorse this coffee maker if it didn’t also make a quality drink. “I taste coffee from all types of brewers, and this one gives a consistently better cup,” says Jim Munson, founder and president of Brooklyn Roasting Company. Ally Walsh, co-founder of Los Angeles’s Canyon Coffee, agrees, noting how smooth the brew comes out every time. There could be some science behind

every time. There could be some science behind that. “It has nine holes or orifices instead of one, so the water spreads out over the whole area of a coffee filter. Plus the heater works very fast. You get coffee much faster,” says Bill Nye, the Science Guy, who makes his coffee in this machine. Another innovation he points out is the funnel shape of the lid, “which greatly reduces the evaporation rate while the thing’s sitting there on the burner. Why doesn’t every machine have this?”

--- 청크 152 ---
Jerad Morrison, co-founder and co-CEO of Sightglass in San Francisco, is also a fan of the Technivorm but prefers a slightly different model. His favorite has all the same attributes, but instead of dispensing your coffee into a glass carafe on top of a burner plate, it goes into a stainless-steel thermal one (just like the Connoisseur). “It keeps coffee plenty hot for several hours,” he says, “without changing the flavor or making it taste burnt.” This thermal-carafe model only comes in

The reason to invest in this machine is clear from the name: It comes with a built-in burr grinder. Yes, it’s on the spendier end, but grinders are quite pricey on their own — not to mention they take up additional space in your kitchen. Beyond the convenience, “the Capresso drip yields the cleanest-tasting cup,” says Kat Odell, author of Day Drinking. Finally, it boasts that thermal carafe that, as I’ve pointed out, many of the experts prefer over a hot plate.

If you want a single-unit coffee maker that can do it all, this Ninja fits the bill. It comes recommended by Strategist writer Arielle Avila who regularly uses the classic brew method (for a carafe of coffee), as well as the “specialty” setting that turns out a thick coffee concentrate, similar to espresso and used in the same manner for milk-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. The machine also has the capability of making iced coffee. Other bonuses include the attached milk frother and a

If you’re interested in a simple pod-based machine, this Nespresso also turns out single servings of espresso and coffee. Textile designer Caroline Hurley and clothing designer Alex Crane (both coffee fanatics) have used it every day for a few years and love it because “it’s just so easy,” Hurley says. You simply place a pod into the slot at the top and click a single button. The maker heats up and brews in seconds, then automatically deposits the used pod in a container in the back to empty

the used pod in a container in the back to empty and recycle (with some specific guidelines).

--- 청크 162 ---
Crane says he appreciates that it only produces one cup at a time so he can watch his consumption. He also notes that it makes “a gentle sound, unlike some others that sound so loud and sinister.” Hurley, meanwhile, says it tastes just as fresh as when you grind your own beans and appreciates that the company offers a wide variety of flavors in a tester pack — “like jelly beans but for coffee” — so you can decide what you like best.

Cold brew makers are not exactly plug-in electric coffee makers, but they’re important nonetheless, especially for iced-coffee-year-round people. This one is a favorite of Dennis Ngo, chef and co-owner of Brooklyn restaurant Di an Di. “I got hooked on the smoothness and low acidity of cold-brewed coffee,” says Ngo. “It lets me tinker with different beans and concentrations. It also stacks for storage, which is an absolute requirement for my tiny New York apartment.”

Michael Philips, director of content and copy at Blue Bottle, recommends the Toddy Cold Brew System, a similarly priced model that he’s been using for nearly two decades in his own home. It’s a little over twice the size (67 ounces instead of 32), but that’s something he appreciates: He brews the concentrate once a week or so and is able to drink one to two cups a day from that amount before he has to start the process over. He’s also partial to the paper filters (the maker includes three to

--- 청크 166 ---
to the paper filters (the maker includes three to start that you can replenish). While they aren’t reusable like the stainless-steel, fine-mesh strainer that comes as part of the Oxo, he says that they “produce a much cleaner cup” with “absolutely no grit.”

This is a straightforward point, of course, but the capacity of a given coffee maker should be a factor in whether or not you choose it for your own setup. Most on this list brew up to eight or 10 cups, with two slightly bigger at 12 cups, and one smaller at four cups. Of course, you can also brew less. Then there are three machines that are able to brew a single cup at a time, helpful if the day-to-day coffee consumption in your household doesn’t require a giant pot. I detail those in the
